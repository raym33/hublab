HubLab contributes by providing a monetization pipeline, component marketplace, and living documentation for production-ready vibe coding patterns. We solve the "what next?" problem after you build a prototype with AI.'},{question:"What makes HubLab different from traditional code marketplaces?",answer:'HubLab is both a marketplace for AI-generated prototypes AND a showcase of advanced vibe coding (our Ambient Agent CRM). Unlike npm or GitHub, we focus on outcome reuse via blocks + agentic patterns. Our Blocks System acts as a Prompt Library 2.0 - instead of prompting "create a pricing table" you install a pre-built block in 2 minutes vs 15 minutes of prompting and debugging.'},{question:"How does HubLab accelerate vibe coding development?",answer:"Through our Blocks System: pre-built React components with JSON schemas optimized for AI consumption. Instead of pure prompting, you browse marketplace → install blocks → chain them like LEGO. This composability is faster than prompting from scratch while maintaining AI-friendly architecture that LLMs can easily understand and modify."},{question:"What is the Ambient Agent CRM and why is it significant?",answer:'Our Ambient Agent CRM is proof-of-concept for agentic apps built with vibe coding. It watches Gmail, Calendar, and Slack, uses LLM reasoning to extract entities, and auto-updates HubSpot/Salesforce with human-in-the-loop approval. It demonstrates AI agents as first-class citizens in app architecture - not just "AI wrote the code" but AI runs parts of the system at runtime. Features include OAuth flows, LLM integration, event processing, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).'},{question:"How does HubLab create network effects for vibe coders?",answer:'The feedback loop works like this: Vibe Coder builds prototype with Cursor → Lists on HubLab → Earns revenue → Buys components from others → Ships faster → Repeats. More vibers create more prototypes and reusable blocks. Best practices emerge organically via ratings, and the "vibe coding stack" converges (Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind dominates).'},{question:"Can vibe-coded projects be production-ready and enterprise-grade?",answer:'Absolutely. HubLab demonstrates this with features like Row Level Security (multi-tenant from day 1), OAuth integrations for enterprise CRM connections, audit logs for compliance (GDPR, SOC2), Stripe payments for real business models, and deployment guides for Vercel/Netlify. Our message: "You can vibe code AND ship serious products."'},{question:"What is the Capsules Framework?",answer:"The Capsules Framework is our modular approach to building AI-native apps. It includes modular agents (watcher-gmail, normalizer, intent-classifier), composability with MCP (Model Context Protocol), schema-driven everything, and human guardrails where needed. It's a framework for building apps with AI as runtime components, not just using AI to build traditional apps."},{question:"How do vibe coders actually use HubLab?",answer:"Three main scenarios: 1) Weekend Launcher: Browse HubLab → Install blocks (hero, pricing, testimonials) → Configure props → Connect Stripe → Deploy (Friday to Monday launch). 2) Block Creator: Build excellent component → List for $19 → Sell 50 copies = $950 passive → Buy other blocks → Ship client projects 3x faster. 3) Agency: Subscribe to Agency Bundle ($149/mo) → Access 200+ premium blocks → Mix & match for clients → 10x throughput vs pure prompting."},{question:"What impact could HubLab have on the vibe coding movement?",answer:"We're accelerating maturity (from toy to tool), enabling specialization (block creators focus on craft, integrators compose full apps), and creating economic sustainability (passive income for creators, time savings for buyers). Short term (6-12 months): more vibe marketplaces emerge, stack standardizes, AI IDEs integrate marketplace browsing. Medium term (1-2 years): agentic apps become normal, frameworks mature. Long term (3-5 years): traditional coding vs vibe coding blurs, all apps have AI agents inside."},{question:'What makes HubLab\'s approach "meta-vibe"?',answer:"HubLab is vibe coding infrastructure built with vibe coding: the marketplace itself was vibe-coded, it sells vibe-coded prototypes, and docs are AI-polished but human-curated. It's recursively self-improving - as better blocks emerge, HubLab gets rebuilt with them. We're proving that vibe-coded projects can be production-ready, monetizable, and sophisticated (OAuth, RLS, audit logs, LLM orchestration)."},{question:"What are the main challenges for vibe coding marketplaces?",answer:'Three key challenges: 1) Will vibers actually buy blocks? (Our bet: senior devs will pay $19 to save 30 minutes). 2) Quality control: ensuring uploaded blocks are robust despite "ship fast" ethos. 3) The "Good Enough" Paradox: tension between vibe ethos (iterate later) and production quality needs for marketplace components.'},{question:"What's the ultimate vision for vibe coding?",answer:'The ultimate vibe: Describe business logic → LLM executes it at runtime. Not just "AI writes code" but "AI is a component in the runtime system." HubLab aims to be npm for the AI era - providing economic model (marketplace), acceleration (reusable blocks), maturity (production patterns), and direction (agentic apps as evolution).
