2. **Theme Applied:** Custom theme configuration for consistent branding
3. **Exported:** Generated production-ready code with one click
4. **Integration:** Added data fetching and state management using our templates

## Usage

Each example is production-ready and can be:
- Copied directly into your project
- Modified to fit your needs
- Used as a reference for your own HubLab exports
- Integrated with your preferred backend/API
